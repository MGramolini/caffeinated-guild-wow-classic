                                    <h6>Tanks: 4</h6>
                                    <p>The first boss fight has two phases; egg phase and burn phase. The egg phase is first and we will split the raid into
                                        four groups and send a team to each corner of the room.</p>
                                    <h4>Phase 1 (Egg)</h4>
                                    <p>We will most likely have 1-2 Paladins controlling Razorgore via the <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/object=177808/orb-of-domination" class="q1">Orb of Domination</a>
                                            to destroy the eggs in the room using <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19873/destroy-egg" class="q1">Destroy Egg</a>.
                                        While this is happening, the four teams will kill the adds that are spawning with priority Mage > Dragon > Legionaire.  We
                                            will have hunters available to kite Dragons if we fall behind in DPS.</p>
                                    <h4>Phase 2 (Burn)</h4>
                                    <p>As soon as the last egg is destroyed, the Paladin who was controlling Razorgore will run to the tanks.  The tanks will
                                            pick up Razorgore and stand at about a 90 degree angle from each other.  Melee will be behind the boss. Razorgore will
                                            occasionally cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=16805/conflagration" class="q1">Conflagration</a>
                                            on the tank so a secondary tank will be needed for this phase.</p>

                                    <p>This fight is started by speaking with Vaelstrasz.</p>
                                    <p>If the fight lasts longer than three minutes, it will most likely be a wipe because <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23513/essence-of-the-red" class="q1" img-src="img/essence_of_the_red.png">Essence of the Red</a>
                                            runs out. Tanks should find a good balance between threat and fire resist gear. 1.3 or 1.4 speed weapon suggested (or Eskhandar Claw)</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Every 15 seconds, Vaelastrasz will cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18173/burning-adrenaline" class="q1" img-src="img/burning_adrenaline.png">Burning Adrenaline</a>
                                        , which does increase damage by 100%, but will kill the target after 20 seconds. Anyone (besides your tank) who receives the buff needs to run
                                        far away from the rest of the raid to not kill anyone when they die.  This should only be cast on mana users and the Main Tank every third time.
                                            When the tank gets the debuff, the next tank should start moving into position to take over.</p>

                                    <p>The best way to position him is by having your warriors at least 90 degrees away from the current tank, near his
                                        <b>left</b> shoulder. Melee DPS should be on the other side of the boss, staying in between his front and rear
                                        <b>right</b> legs. All casters, ranged DPS, and healers should be next to the wall directly across from the
                                        warriors (melee DPS side) on the other side of Vaelestrasz.</p>

                                    <p>Most of the difficulty in the fight is in reaching the boss, which requires some finesse. This is because there of the
                                        suppression rooms which are filled with <b>Suppression Devices</b>.</p>
                                    <h4>Phase 1 (Suppression Approach)</h4>
                                    <p>These can be difficult because they create <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22247" class="q1" img-src="img/suppression_aura.png">Suppression
                                        Aura</a>, which will make everything <b>five</b> times slower. It's like being stuck in a molasses flood, while the
                                        enemies don’t mind it at all.</p>
                                    <p>Each <b>Suppression Device</b> is guarded by whelps that should be AOEd. These whelps will respawn after 30
                                         seconds, so you must move quickly between traps. The devices can be turned off by rogues using Disarm Trap. 
                                         Throughout the gauntlet, 2-3 rogues should be Stealthed 100% of the time and use Distract to help them
                                         turn off the devices. One of these rogues should be checking the rear devices to make sure the back end 
                                         of the raid doesn't get slowed while moving forward.</p>
                                    <p>There are also some stronger mobs called <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12468" class="q1">Death Talon Hatcher</a>s. The hatchers respawn after 20 minutes and should
                                         be killed by hunters and melee DPS.</p>
                                    <h4>Phase 2 (Boss)</h4>
                                    <p>To properly set the fight up, have your main tank pull the boss and head to the nearest corner. Your offtanks will
                                        follow and set up 90 degrees away from the main tank to avoid <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20677" class="q1">Cleave</a>
                                        They can start generating threat after a few seconds. DPS can start <b>when the offtanks are in place</b>! Depending on threat
                                        generation, this should be 15-30 seconds.</p>
                                    <p>The biggest problem with the fight is <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18670" class="q1">Knock Away</a>, which
                                         will be used frequently and will reduce the threat of your current tank by half. The new tank with highest threat
                                         should move to where the previous main tank was. Your DPSers should always make sure they are under the second tanks&apos; threat value.
                                        Threat may also be an issue for healers during this fight.</p>
                                    <p>Approximately every 25 seconds, the boss will use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24573" class="q1">Mortal Strike</a> for
                                        more than 5,000 damage, which will also apply the healing debuff. The priest with the most +healing gear in raid should cast 
                                        a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=27607" class="q1">Power Word: Shield</a> on the tank for a buffer
                                         as it is twice as effective as a heal while the debuff is active.</p>

                                        <h3>Firemaw, Ebonroc, and Flamegor</h3>
                                        <p>The next three dragons share some mechanics, so I will describe the similarities then the differences.</p>
                                        <p>All three dragons can use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22539" class="q1">Shadow Flame</a> on the tank(s) in front of them.
                                            We will use at least two tanks with an <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15138" class="q3">Onyxia Scale Cloak</a> to prevent the DOT
                                            and inevitable death.</p>
                                        <p>The dragons also share <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23339" class="q1">Wing Buffet</a>, which reduces threat. The offtank(s) will taunt and
                                            move into position before the ability is used so that they get hit by it <b>instead of your main tank</b>. The main tank will swap positions
                                            with the offtank (90 degrees from the front of the boss).</p>

                                            applied to anyone in line of sight of the boss. Stacks of the debuff should be reset between 5-10 stacks depending on healing/kill speed. Healers
                                            should take advantage of line of sight so they are able to heal the tank(s) but not be hit by the debuff.</p>
                                        <p>We will position the boss at the doorway into the first drakinoid/goblin room after Broodlord.  Melee dps will be out of line of sight of the 
                                            healers and will have to run back around the corner to bandage/get heals and reset debuff stacks. Ranged DPS will stand next to the healers and sidestep out of line of sight
                                            to reset debuff stacks</p>

                                            They should be positioned at 90 degrees from each other making a + shape with the raid (DPS and heals cardinal south of the main tank).</p>

                                    <p>This is a relatively long fight, so it may be beneficial for healers to wear more mp5/spirit gear.</p>
                                    <p>The first mechanic to note would be the breaths.  Each breath corresponds to a dragonflight's color (red, green, blue, black, or bronze). Chromaggus
                                        will use a combination two of these five breaths per week. He breathes about every 30 seconds.</p>

                                    <p>The next mechanic is afflictions.  These need to be dispelled quickly as having all five afflictions will cause you to become
                                        a drakinoid, which can easily cause a wipe.  The absolute most afflictions anyone should have at any time is three (3).

                                        These are usually passed out to tanks, healers, and hunters. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030">Restorative Potions</a>s can also be very useful here as well. Since some
                                        of these fights have threat issues, mages may opt to get ice block to make them much safer on this and other fights at least during
                                        the first few weeks.

                                    <p>Chromaggus also has a skin color change which indicates increased damage from specific spell schools.  This is great to increase DPS
                                        for casters, however, they should also be careful during this time to not pull threat especially if he does bronze breaths.</p>

                                    <p>The final fight has three phases: Drakinoids, Nefarian, and Bone Constructs. To start the fight, someone needs to talk to Nefarian.</p>
                                    <h4>Phase One (Drakonids)</h4>
                                    <p>Nefarian will Mind Control, Fear, and Shadow Bolt members of the raid. He cannot be interrupted or attacked during this phase.
                                        Similar to Chromaggus, the drakinoids will be two of the five possible colors.  Only one color will spawn from each doorway.
                                        We will tank both groups on top of each other and AOE while the melee focuses the more diffuclt color of the week and

                                    <dl>
                                        <dt>Drakinoids</dt>
                                        <dd><b>Red</b> – Resists fire. Deals fire damage in a cone.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Blue</b> – Resists frost. Drains mana and reduces attack speed.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Green</b> – Resists nature. Also casts a stun.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Black</b> – Resists shadow and fire. Deals direct (strong) fire damage.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Bronze</b> – Resists arcane. Also lowers casting and attack speed.</dd>

                                    <p>Blue and Black are the likely targets for physical damage assistance.</p>
                                    <h4 >Phase Two (Nefarian)</h4>
                                    <p>This phase starts with Nefarian casting <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22992" class="q1">Shadow Flame</a> on the entire raid.
                                        Everyone should have an <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15138">Onyxia Scale Cloak</a> equipped OR get behind Nefarian&apos;s throne
                                        prior to the 42nd drakinoid being killed.</p>
                                    <p>Now Nefarian lands and can be attacked. Watch out for breath and cleaves. He will AOE fear approximately every 30 seconds. (40 yard range)
                                        <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=28440" class="q1">Veil of Shadow</a> should be decursed ASAP during this phase (druid/mage). The next notable
                                        ability is the class calls.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>What makes the fight really interesting is when Nefarian decides to antagonize a specific class in your raid
                                        group. He can call out any class in your raid, which will result in some very negative effects for all
                                        corresponding raid members of the class. Some are far more impactful than others (hunters), but they must all be
                                        dealt with properly.</p>
                                    <p>Here is what each class will suffer when Nefarian focuses on them:</p>
                                    <dl>
                                        <dt>Class calls</dt>
                                        <dd><b>Druid</b> – Morphed into Cat Form and unable to shapeshift.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Hunter</b> – Ranged weapon in hand will immediately break and lose all durability.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Mage</b> – Will cast Wild Polymorph on any other members of the raid regardless of where they are.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Paladin</b> – Places a Blessing of Protection on Nefarian.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Priest</b> – Any targeted, direct heals will also apply Corrupted Healing, a DoT that stacks.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Rogue</b> – Placed next to Nefarian and unable to move.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Warlock</b> – Summons a pair of infernals to stun the warlock and nearby raid members.</dd>
                                        <dd><b>Warrior</b> – Swapped into Berserker Stance with double the damage taken effect and unable to swap stances.</dd>
                                    </dl>
                                    <p>Hunters should have at least one backup weapon and macros to help swap in a cheap bow to use during class calls.</p>
                                    <h4>Phase Three (Nefarian + Bone Constructs)</h4>
                                    <p>At 20% health, the final phase of the fight will begin. Nefarian will raise <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=14605" class="q1">Bone Constructs</a>
                                        from all the drakonids that died earlier. They don’t have much health, but they do hit quite hard. They should all be AOEd down as quick as possible. We will
                                        hold DPS at 24% if a class call is near.</p>
                                    <p>With some mage and paladin coordination, this is pretty easy. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10278" class="q1">Blessing
                                        of Protection</a> the mages and everyone else throw a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13180">Stratholme Holy Water</a> on the constructs.
                                        Warriors can <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=871" class="q1">Shield Wall</a> and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=1161" class="q1">Challenging Shout</a>
                                        to assist with controlling the adds. Paladins can also <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10318" class="q1">Holy Wrath</a> if mana is not an issue.</p>
                                    <p>The rest of the fight is just Phase Two continued.</p>
